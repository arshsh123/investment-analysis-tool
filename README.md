Investment Analysis Tool (High School Project)
This is a personal project I built as a high school student to explore how fundamental financial data might help pick companies that outperform the market.
It scores companies based on SG&A efficiency, inventory turnover, and net margin â€” then simulates a basic backtest comparing those companies to the S&P 500.
This is mock data only and not financial advice.
